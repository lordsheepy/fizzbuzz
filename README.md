Fizzbuzzsimple and fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzzsimple was just my quick and dirty solution. After completing that I
sat down and thought about how I'd actuallly approach the problem. I thought that
the key-value pairs in a dict would be perfect for the assignment. Writing to a
response string seemed the easiest way to provide the answer, and the dict was
sorted prior to being worked through to give it consistent answers. The last
step was to check that the response string wasn't empty, and if it was, return
the original number in string form.
